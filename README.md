This project implements the classic game Captain's Mistress (also known as Connect Four) in Python. The objective of the game is for a player to connect four of their game pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## How to Play?

### How to start the program?
To start the game, simply run the Python file **_game_engine.py_**. The game runs in the console. The console program is terminated after one game is finished. To play another game, just start the Python file game_engine.py again.
#### Playing a 1 vs 1
If you want to play against a second player, press [0] at the start of the game in the menu. The first move is randomly assigned to one of each players (Yellow, Red).
Enter the column number where you want to drop your game piece (0-6) when prompted. The game ends when one player connects four pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or when the game board is full of tokens and there is no winner.

#### Playing Against the Computer
To play against the computer, enter [1] when prompted in the console. The game will then initiate a match against the computer AI. The token color and who has the first move, the computer or you, is randomly generated.
