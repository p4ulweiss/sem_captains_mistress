Theorie Software Design

The Provided code shows several shortcomings that contradict some of the Fundamental design principles. Due to it using particularly lengthy methods within the existing classes, which not only violates the principle of KISS but also significantly impair code maintainability. These lengthy methods hinder the comprehensibility for Devs who are new to the code but also increase the risk of errors and make it challenging to identify and modify specific functionalities.

Due to there being an inadequate separation of functionalities within the classes the code also suggests a disregard for the Single Responsibility Principle. The size of these classes suggests that they may be undertaking multiple responsibilities, leading to increased coupling and diminished flexibility. Their lack of documentation contravenes the principles of DRY and makes reusability of the code harder. Developers will therefor struggle with reusing existing functionalities, which results in poorer code quality and a massively increased maintenance overhead.

In addition to the insufficient separation of functionalities within the classes, the strong coupling between classes may result in changes to one class causing unexpected effects on other parts of the system. This contradicts the principle of low coupling and impairs the flexibility and extensibility of the code.
overall, the neglect of these fundamental design principles leads to poorer code quality, reduced flexibility, and increased maintenance overhead, ultimately hindering the development and scalability of the system.
