Singleton Pattern

The Problem: In certain scenarios, it's necessary to ensure that a class has only one instance and that this instance is globally accessible. For example, it might be necessary to instantiate a shared resource like a database connection or a logging class.

The Solution: The Singleton Pattern provides a solution to this problem by ensuring that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. This is achieved by making the constructor of the class private and providing a static method that always returns the same instance. Upon the first call to this method, the instance is created, and for all subsequent calls, the same instance is returned.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in Singleton: The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In the Singleton Pattern, it's important to ensure that the class responsible for creating and managing the Singleton instance is only responsible for that task. If the class takes on additional responsibilities, it violates the SRP and becomes less maintainable and flexible. An example of violating the SRP in the Singleton Pattern could be if the Singleton class is responsible not only for instantiating and managing the Singleton instance but also for other tasks like database access or logging. It is a must to separate responsibilities clearly to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.

Possible Application: The Singleton Pattern is frequently used in scenarios where resources need to be shared across the application, such as managing database connections, logging mechanisms, or configuration settings. For example, in a game, a Game Manager class might be implemented as a Singleton to manage game state and resources globally.
